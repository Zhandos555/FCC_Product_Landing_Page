I need to change grid part in the styling
I have 3 pictures, 2 pictures in one row and below on the left side I have 3rd picture
So I have to place 3rd below two pictures and in the middle of them, this way it will look good
If someone is reading this and you know how to do it, please show me?) Thanks in advance!
Also I have a problem. I accidentally created new branch on git named master, didn't change it to main
I saw after adding files and creating master branch that I did something wrong
Now in a git I can't switch to main branch even I have it created
The thing is I want to delete main branch, because I work here only on master branch
If you know how to fix this, please share your knowledge. Thanks in advance!
I tried several methods, unfortunately couldn't succeed. Didn't use google
Will google later.
